# piksels, a low-level, strongly typed graphics API

**piksels** is the next iteration over [luminance](https://github.com/luminance-rs), a long-running graphics ecosystem
that started a long time ago as a Haskell library. Instead of keeping updating the old API and bending it to satisfy
today requirements, it was best to design a new system: **piksels** is born.

**piksels** is currently in development and no release was made so far. `v0.0.0` is a placeholder version to be sure no
one else squats the place on crates.io.
